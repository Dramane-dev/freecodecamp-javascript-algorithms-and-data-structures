# 📚 FreeCodeCamp – Explored Lessons & Interviews

Welcome to my digital logbook where I trace step by step my progress through the lessons, interviews, and technical challenges from [freeCodeCamp.org](https://www.freecodecamp.org).  
The goal? Fuel my passion for programming while strengthening my skills, documenting my journey and reflections.

## 🎯 Repository Goal

This GitHub repository centralizes all lessons I've dissected, tested, and documented in my own way.

For each major section (e.g.: pyramid generator...), you'll find:

## 🧠 Why this repo?

Because learning is great.
But learning by writing, testing, and documenting — that’s where the real magic happens ✨
I want this repo to be both a portfolio of my growth and a thinking hub for the challenges I encounter along the way.
💡 Even though most exercises expect vanilla JavaScript, I’ll intentionally be using TypeScript throughout this repo — for type safety, clarity, and personal discipline.

## 🫶🏽 Thank you, freeCodeCamp

Big shoutout to the freeCodeCamp team for their incredible work 🙌🏽
If this repo can help other devs make sense of the concepts covered, that’s a total win in my book.
