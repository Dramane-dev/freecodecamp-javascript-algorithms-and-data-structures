# 🧱 Pyramid Generator

## 🎯 Objective

This chapter is all about mastering **core JavaScript fundamentals** through a hands-on practice project: building a **Pyramid Generator** 🏛️

You'll sharpen your skills with:

- **Arrays** 🧩
- **Strings** 🧵
- **Functions** 🧠
- **Loops** 🔁
- **Conditional statements** (if/else) ⚖️

This is a great warm-up to get comfortable with the logic behind basic algorithms and output formatting.

## 📌 Note

> While the original freeCodeCamp exercises are written in **JavaScript**, I’ve chosen to solve them using **TypeScript** for stronger type safety, clearer logic, and better maintainability over time.
